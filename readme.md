start learning about the tile-matching / match-three topics
there are different "complexities" that can be used in real game, some of them are: valuing longer chains higher, looking for combos. In the test this can ignore, focus only on matching-three

okay, checked the puzzle&dragons game, there are horizontal & vertical matches, 3 and more matches, combos etc.

As no additional requirements, we will do next assumptions:

- match 3 only
- do not count any combos, vertical matches etc.

So make it simple for now, horizontal match-3 logic, with 1 iteration (once the finger is out released we only calculate the path and the matches)
